<b>Detecting Hate Speech on Tweets in Indonesian Language Using Machine Learning Approach</b><br>

This research aims to detect hate speech  on tweets in Indonesian language. 
The objective of this research is to compare the performance of several features and machine learning algorithms for hate speech detection. Features that extracted in this research are word n-gram with n=1 and n=2, character n-gram with n=3 and n=4, and negative sentiment. 
Classification is performed using Na√Øve Bayes, Bayesian Logistic Regression, Random Forest Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. An 88,6% F-Measure average is achieved when using word n-gram feature with Bayesian Logistic Regression. Results also show that word n-gram feature outperforms character n-gram.
